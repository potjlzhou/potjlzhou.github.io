			Topic of Thematic Website
		</h1>
		<p>
			The topic for my thematic website would be about independent bookstore. I plan to explain the origin of it and introduce some other types of bookstores. My focus would be on the hardship independent bookstores are facing along with how they are adapting to the current state such as changing ways of operation or advocating certain policies like Fixed Book Price. Independent bookstores in Taiwan and other countries will also be shown in the website as examples.
