			Topic of Thematic Website
		</h1>
		<p>
			The topic for my thematic website would be about independent bookstore. I plan to explain the origin of it and introduce some other types of bookstores. My main focus would be on the hardship they are facing and how the bookstores are changing to adapt to the current state. Examples of bookstores in Taiwan and other countries will be given along with some of the governmentâ€™s policies such as Fixed Book Price or consumption voucher would be discussed as well.
