			Special and Unforgetable Experience

					A Short Yet Satisfying Encounter
				</h2>
				<p>
					About a year ago, Care-life club receives several reports that a dog was found around the school entrance. When the club members went to check on it, the dog turned out to be severely injured and was taken to the veterinarian immediately. After some examinations, the vet told us that the dog may have been through a car accident since its lower body was almost paralyzed, not to mention the distorted foreleg hanging. There is no doubt that the dog was abandoned after the injuries, especially since it’s a poodle, a breed that is mostly kept as pet.<br/>
					After some discussion, the club members decided to take care of it and named it “Box” since we literally found it in a box. Thereafter, Box underwent some surgeries and eventually was able to walk, or crawl, for a short distance. It was kept in the club office so club members could check on it at any time. Moreover, shifts are arranged to help express Box’s bladder and bowels since the nerve damage on the back is too severe. Even though it takes much more time and effort to take care of Box compared to other dogs on the campus, the club members were more than happy to see Box regaining vitality. From time to time, we would take Box to the square in front of Mong Man Wai Building to let it enjoy the sunshine and the breeze. Nevertheless, all this came to an end when Box was found laying and barely moving last Sunday. The club members at that shift were distraught and took it to the veterinarian right away. However, Box had passed away before arriving.<br/>
					The vet couldn’t tell what caused his sudden death and his body was taken to be cremated this Thursday. This event had struck so abruptly that many members, including me, still couldn’t tell how to feel about it. I still remember that the very first time Box was taken to the veterinarian, even the vet suggested mercy killing due to its poor condition. When the club declined the offer, I would be lying to say that I supported the decision wholeheartedly. Even so, after countless times of looking after Box, holding its small and sometimes trembling body in my hand, I realize that it is a precious life we are facing, and it deserves our respect no matter what. The encounter with Box has taught me a lesson and I hope Box is now somewhere bathing in the sunshine and enjoying his life.
