					A Short Yet Satisfying Encounter
				</h2>
				<p>
					This incident happened some weeks ago on the campus when a new unknown dog was seen wandering around the campus. At first no one in the club really paid any attention to it because stray dogs from outside the campus come to the campus from time to time but only few would stay. However, as time passes, we receive more reports and finally decided to check the dog in person. I volunteered along with two club members then to take the dog to the club office since I had come into contact with the dog when it was first reported. After scanning it for the identity chip, we learned that the dog did has a owner, yet couldnâ€™t figure whether it was abandoned or lost.
