					About a year ago, Care-life club received several reports that a poodle was abandoned around the school entrance. When the club members went to check on it, the dog turned out to be severely injured and was taken to the veterinarian immediately. After some examinations, the vet told us that the dog may have been through a car accident since its lower body was almost paralyzed, not to mention the distorted foreleg hanging.

					After some discussion, the club members decided to take care of it and named it “Box” since we literally found it in a box. Thereafter, Box underwent some surgeries and eventually was able to walk, or crawl, for a short distance. It was kept in the club office so club members could check on it at any time. Moreover, shifts were arranged to help express Box’s bladder and bowels since the nerve damage on the back is too severe. Even though it takes much more time and effort to take care of Box compared to other dogs on the campus, the club members were more than happy to see Box regaining vitality. From time to time, we would take Box to the square in front of Mong Man Wai Building to let it enjoy the sunshine and the breeze. Nevertheless, all this came to an end when Box was found laying and barely moving last Sunday. The club members at that shift were distraught and took it to the veterinarian right away. However, Box had passed away before arriving.

					The vet couldn’t tell what caused his sudden death and his body was taken to be cremated this Thursday. This event had struck so abruptly that many members, including me, still couldn’t tell how to feel about it. I still remember that the very first time Box was taken to the veterinarian, even the vet suggested mercy killing due to its poor condition. When the club declined the offer, I would be lying to say that I supported the decision wholeheartedly. Even so, after countless times of looking after Box, holding its small and sometimes trembling body in my hand, I realize that it is a precious life we are facing, and it deserves our respect no matter what. The encounter with Box has taught me a priceless lesson and I hope Box is now somewhere bathing in the sunshine and enjoying his life.

					大約在一年前懷生社接到同學通報說有貴賓狗被遺棄在校門口，當社團成員前去查看時才發現被通報的狗身上的傷很嚴重，並且在當下立即將他送至獸醫院。經過一些檢查，獸醫解釋這隻狗可能有經歷過車禍因為牠的下半身幾乎全部癱瘓，還有一隻前腳彎曲骨折。<br/>
					經過一些討論，社團決定照顧牠並且將它命名為「箱子」因為當時發現牠時就是在箱子裡。在那之後，箱子也經歷過一些手術，最後終於可以稍微行走或爬行一小段距離，而為了確保能時刻查看牠的情況，社團決定將牠安置在社團辦事處，每天排班的人力也需要幫箱子擠叫和擠便因為牠後背神經的傷過於嚴重無法自行排尿排便。雖然相比其他校浪，在箱子身上花費的時間心力多很多，但是能夠看到牠身體一天天情況好轉，社內的成員都相當開心，有時候我們甚至會帶箱子到蒙民偉樓前的廣場休息曬太陽、吹風。然而這一切都在上禮拜日畫下句點，排班的人員發現箱子躺著幾乎沒有在動，當時相當緊張立刻帶牠到獸醫院，但是在抵達醫院前牠已經失去呼吸了。<br/>
					獸醫無法說明為什麼牠會突然離去，而牠的屍體就在這個禮拜四送去火化了。這件事情發生得過於突然，許多成員包括我都還不知道該如何反應；而我依然記得最一開始帶箱子去醫院時獸醫曾提出要不要安樂死，因為牠的情況真的不太樂觀，在社團最終決定照顧牠時我心裡面也曾存有一絲不滿。即使如此，經過許多次照顧箱子的經驗，一手握著牠瘦小而有時顫抖著的身軀，我才意識到牠也是一個相當珍貴的生命，值得我們尊敬對待。和箱子的相遇教會我寶貴的一課，而我希望牠現在正在某處像以前最喜歡的一樣沐浴著陽光，享受生活。
