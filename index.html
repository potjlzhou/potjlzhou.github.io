			<b>Autobiography</b>

			<section>
				<p>
					My name is Chia-Li Chou and I am now a sophomore studying Foreign Languages and Literature at National Tsing Hua University.<br/>
					Born in Tainan, I have heard countless local anecdotes and histories, which makes me familiar with and fascinated by storytelling. As I grow up, the curiosity over stories only seem to grow. During senior high school, I attended several projects visiting Tainan’s historic regions or ruins. For instance, I had once slept in a local bookstore and visited areas around, listening to what had happened in the ancient temples or the crumbling buildings. Since I’m living in Hsinchu now, I have determined to take the opportunity to know more about the city. For example, one of the projects I had attended gives me the chance to interview local farmers in Emei Township.

					Additionally, I enjoy taking parts in various activities. While in high school I joined the club working on the school magazine along with the student association, I currently have joined the school’s Tennis Club and Care-life Club. The two clubs, especially the latter one, have greatly enriched my life by giving me chances to be explore environments I may be completely unfamiliar with. There’s no doubt that my life now fulfilling; nevertheless, I’m looking forward to taking part in different activities and programs in the future as well.

			<b>自傳</b>
			</h3>

				<p>
					我的名字是周嘉俐，目前就讀於國立清華大學外國語文學系。
					出生於台南，在經過多年的耳濡目染，對於地方的文化及歷史我是再熟悉不過了，然而對於新竹，雖然家中有過多次到訪旅遊的經驗，一直以來都只有走馬看花程度的了解；因此在上大學後我在心裡默默記下，想要在畢業前多了解當地的文化。除了心中的願望，我平時樂於參加各式各樣的活動，不論屬性為何都能引起我的興趣，在上大學後除了加入校內的網球社，我同時也在關懷生命社擔任幹部。現在的生活對我來說非常充實，我能夠藉由社團活動接觸不同的人事物，一方面增加見識也能幫助我踏出舒適圈。我期許自己未來能夠成為一個有故事的人，有內涵吸引他人也能給予有用的意見，為此在大學的生活裡我依然有許多需要探索了解的課題。
