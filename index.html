				My name is Chou, Chia-Li and I am now a sophomore studying foreign language and literature at National Tsing Hua University. Throughout my life, I’ve always enjoyed listening to stories whether it is in the form of written texts, visual media, etc. We all have heard of similar quotes stating that not knowing history is like being a leaf that doesn’t know it is part of a tree. Born in Tainan, I am more than familiar with the quote and have been reminded countless time of how ignorant and shameless it is to not know the history of my hometown. There certainly had been a phase of rebellion when I couldn’t care less about the warnings, but luckily, my friends invited me to attend a local program. Simply put, we walked over 40 kilometers in about a day. Starting from the afternoon, the “troop” passed my school, temples, to places without any streetlights, with only dim starlight or flashlights my friends pointed at me from time to time to bother me. There was no dramatic change of me suddenly turning into an expert in history after it. However, I managed to connect the stories and tales I heard along the way with stories I see in books or animations. The scenes in my everyday life are thus no longer plain sight but a mix of memories and stories that I later learn to appreciate.

				Aside from my interest in storytelling, I enjoy taking part in various activities as well. In high school, I was joined the club working on the school magazine and the student association. Currently, I attended the school’s carelife club and tennis club. One of my beliefs is that one needs more than job or academic performance to enrich his or her life; nevertheless, I’ve come to a realization that “sacrifices” is needed if I am to really explore any interest or field in depth. Take the carelife club, while being one of the members makes me deal with problem or issues I wouldn’t have had a single idea about, the work are time-consuming. With most of my time occupied, trying to hold on to trivial time I used to let pass easily is now part of my goals. In other words, I’m hoping to pick up my old habit, which is drawing since, to me, it is perhaps the best outlet for my inner thoughts and to help make my creativity flow.
